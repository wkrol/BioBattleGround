= What's new in Propel 1.5? =

[[PageOutline]]

First and foremost, don't be frightened by the long list of new features that follows. Propel 1.5 is completely backwards compatible with Propel 1.4 and 1.3, so there is no hidden cost to benefit from these features. If you didn't do it already, upgrade the propel libraries, rebuild your model, and you're done - your application can now use the Propel 1.5 features.

== New Query API ==

This is the killer feature of Propel 1.5. It will transform the painful task of writing Criteria queries into a fun moment.

=== Model Queries ===

Along Model and Peer classes, Propel 1.5 now generates one Query class for each table. These Query classes inherit from Criteria, but have additional abilities since the Propel generator has a deep knowledge of your schema. That means that Propel 1.5 advises that you use ModelQueries instead of raw Criteria.

Model queries have smart filter methods for each column, and termination methods on their own. That means that instead of writing:

{{{
#!php
<?php
$c = new Criteria();
$c->add(BookPeer::TITLE, 'War And Peace');
$book = BookPeer::doSelectOne($c);
}}}

You can write:

{{{
#!php
<?php
$q = new BookQuery();
$q->filterByTitle('War And Peace');
$book = $q->findOne();
}}}

In addition, each Model Query class benefits from a factory method called `create()`, which returns a new instance of the query class. And the filter methods return the current query object. So it's even easier to write the previous query as follows:

{{{
#!php
<?php
$book = BookQuery::create()
  ->filterByTitle('War And Peace');
  ->findOne();
}}}

The termination methods are `find()`, `findOne()`, `count()`, `paginate()`, `update()`, and `delete()`. They all accept a connection object as last parameter.

Remember that a Model Query IS a Criteria. So your Propel 1.4 code snippets still work:

{{{
#!php
<?php
$book = BookQuery::create()
  ->addJoin(BookPeer::AUTHOR_ID, AuthorPeer::ID);
  ->add(AuthorPeer::LAST_NAME, 'Tolstoi')
  ->addAscendingOrderByColumn(BookPeer::TITLE)
  ->findOne();
}}}

But you will soon see that it's faster to use the generated methods of the Model Query classes:

{{{
#!php
<?php
$book = BookQuery::create()
  ->useAuthorQuery();
    ->filterByLastName('Tolstoi')
  ->endUse()
  ->orderByTitle()
  ->findOne();
}}}

That's right, you can embed a query into another; Propel guesses the join to apply from the foreign key declared in your schema.

That makes it very easy to package your own custom model logic into reusable query methods. After a while, your code can easily look like the following:

{{{
#!php
<?php
$books = BookQuery::create()
  ->filterByPublisher($publisher)
  ->cheap()
  ->recent()
  ->useAuthorQuery();
    ->stillAlive()
    ->famous()
  ->endUse()
  ->orderByTitle()
  ->find();
}}}

The Model Queries can understand `findByXXX()` method calls, where `'XXX'` is the phpName of a column of the model. That answers one of the most common customization need:

{{{
#!php
<?php
$book = BookQuery::create()->findOneByTitle('War And Peace');
}}}

Eventually, these Query classes will replace the Peer classes; you should place all the code necessary to request or alter Model object in these classes. The Criteria/Peer way of doing queries still work exactly the same as in previous Propel versions, so your existing applications won't suffer from this update.

'''Tip''': Incidentally, if you use an IDE with code completion, you will see that writing a query has never been so easy.

=== Collections And On-Demand Hydration ===

The `find()` method of generated Model Query objects returns a `PropelCollection` object. You can use this object just like an array of model objects, iterate over it using `foreach`, access the objects by key, etc.
  
{{{
#!php
<?php
$books = BookQuery::create()
  ->limit(5)
  ->find(); // $books is a PropelCollection object
foreach ($books as $book) {
  echo $book->getTitle();
}
}}}

Propel also returns a `PropelCollection` object instead of an array when you use a getter for a one-to-many relationship:

{{{
#!php
<?php
$books = $author->getBooks(); // $books is a PropelCollection object
}}}

If your code relies on list of objects being arrays, you will need to update it a little. The `PropelCollection` object provides a method for most common array operations:

{{{
Array                    | Collection object
------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- 
foreach($books as $book) | foreach($books as $book)
count($books)            | count($books)     or $books->count()
$books[]= $book          | $books[]= $book   or $books->append($book)
$books[0]                | $books[0]         or $books->getFirst()
$books[123]              | $books[123]       or $books->offsetGet(123)
unset($books[1])         | unset($books[1])  or $books->remove(1)
empty($books)            | $books->isEmpty()
in_array($book, $books)  | $books->contains($book)
array_pop($books)        | $books->pop()
etc.
}}}

'''Warning''': `empty($books)` always returns false when using a collection, even on a non-empty one. This is a PHP limitation. Prefer `$books->isEmpty()`, or `count($books)>0`.

'''Tip''': If you can't afford updating your code to support collections instead of arrays, you can still ask Propel to generate 1.4-compatible model objects by overriding the `propel.builder.object.class` setting in your `build.properties`, as follows:

{{{
#!ini
propel.builder.object.class = builder.om.PHP5ObjectNoCollectionBuilder
}}}

The `PropelCollection` class offers even more methods that you will soon use a lot:

{{{
#!php
<?php
$books->getArrayCopy()   // get the array inside the collection
$books->toArray()        // turn all objects to associative arrays
$books->getPrimaryKeys() // get an array of the primary keys of all the objects in the collection
$books->getModel()       // return the model of the collection, e.g. 'Book'
}}}

Another advantage of using a collection instead of an array is that Propel can hydrate model objects on demand. Using this feature, you'll never fall short of memory again. Available through the `setFormatter()` method of Model Queries, on-demand hydration is very easy to trigger:

{{{
#!php
<?php
$books = BookQuery::create()
  ->limit(50000)
  ->setFormatter(ModelCriteria::FORMAT_ON_DEMAND) // just add this line
  ->find();
foreach ($books as $book) {
  echo $book->getTitle();
}
}}}

In this example, Propel will hydrate the `Book` objects row by row, after the `foreach` call, and reuse the memory between each iteration. The consequence is that the above code won't use more memory when the query returns 50,000 results than when it returns 5.

`ModelCriteria::FORMAT_ON_DEMAND` is one of the many formatters provided by the new Query objects. You can also get a collection of associative arrays instead of objects, if you don't need any of the logic stored in your model object, by using `ModelCriteria::FORMAT_ARRAY`.

The [wiki:Users/Documentation/1.5/ModelCriteria documentation] describes each formatter, and how to use it.

=== Model Criteria ===

Generated Model Queries inherit from `ModelCriteria`, which extends your good old `Criteria`, and adds a few useful features. Basically, a `ModelCriteria` is a `Criteria` linked to a Model; by using the information stored in the generated TableMaps at runtime, `ModelCriteria` offers powerful methods to simplify the process of writing a query.

For instance, `ModelCriteria::where()` provides similar functionality to `Criteria::add()`, except that its [http://www.php.net/manual/en/pdostatement.bindparam.php PDO-like syntax] removes the burden of Criteria constants for comparators.

{{{
#!php
<?php
$book = BookQuery::create()
  ->where('Book.Title LIKE ?', 'War And P%')
  ->findOne();
}}}

Propel analyzes the clause passed as first argument of `where()` to determine which escaping to use for the value passed as second argument. In the above example, the `Book::TITLE` column is declared as `VARCHAR` in the schema, so Propel will bind the title as a string. 

The `where()` method can also accept more complex clauses. You just need to explicit every column name as `'ModelClassName.ColumnPhpName'`, as follows:

{{{
#!php
<?php
$book = BookQuery::create()
  ->where('UPPER(Book.Title) LIKE ?', 'WAR AND P%')
  ->where('(Book.Price * 100) <= ?', 1500)
  ->findOne();
}}}

Another great addition of `ModelCriteria` is the `join()` method, which just needs the name of a related model to build a JOIN clause:

{{{
#!php
<?php
$books = BookQuery::create()
  ->join('Book.Author')
  ->where('CONCAT(Author.FirstName, " ", Author.LastName) = ?', 'Leo Tolstoi')
  ->find();
}}}

`ModelCriteria` has a built-in support for table aliases, which allows to setup a query using two joins on the same table, which was not possible with the `Criteria` object:

{{{
#!php
<?php
$books = BookQuery::create('b') // use 'b' as an alias for 'Book' in the query
  ->join('b.Author a')          // use 'a' as an alias for 'Author' in the query 
  ->where('CONCAT(a.FirstName, " ", a.LastName) = ?', 'Leo Tolstoi')
  ->find();
}}}

This syntax probably looks familiar, because it is very close to SQL. So you probably won't need long to figure out how to write a complex query with it. The documentation offers [wiki:Users/Documentation/1.5/ModelCriteria an entire chapter] dedicated to the new `ModelCriteria` class. Make sure you read it to see the power of this new query API.

=== Criteria Enhancements ===

Generated queries and ModelQueries are not the only ones to have received a lot of attention in Propel 1.5. The Criteria object itself sees a few improvements, that will ease the writing of queries with complex logic.

`Criteria::addOr()` operates the way you always expected it to. For instance, in Propel 1.4, `addOr()` resulted in a SQL `AND` if called on a column with no other condition:

{{{
#!php
<?php
// addOr() used to work on a column with an existing condition
$c = new Criteria();
$c->add(BookPeer::TITLE, '%Leo%', Criteria::LIKE);
$c->addOr(BookPeer::TITLE, '%Tolstoi%', Criteria::LIKE);
// translates in SQL as
// WHERE (book.TITLE LIKE '%Leo%' OR book.TITLE LIKE '%Tolstoi%')

// addOr() used to fail on a column with no existing condition
$c = new Criteria();
$c->add(BookPeer::TITLE, '%Leo%', Criteria::LIKE);
$c->addOr(BookPeer::ISBN, '1234', Criteria::EQUAL);
// translates in SQL as
// WHERE book.TITLE LIKE '%Leo%' AND book.ISBN = '1234'
}}}

This is fixed in Propel 1.5. This means that you don't need to call upon the `Criterion` object for a simple OR clause:

{{{
#!php
<?php
// addOr() now works on a column with no existing condition
$c = new Criteria();
$c->add(BookPeer::TITLE, '%Leo%', Criteria::LIKE);
$c->addOr(BookPeer::ISBN, '1234', Criteria::EQUAL);
// translates in SQL as
// WHERE (book.TITLE LIKE '%Leo%' OR book.ISBN = '1234')

// and it's much faster to write than
$c = new Criteria();
$c1 = $c->getNewCriterion(BookPeer::TITLE, '%Leo%', Criteria::LIKE);
$c2 = $c->getNewCriterion(BookPeer::ISBN, '1234', Criteria::EQUAL);
$c1->addOr($c2);
$c->add($c1);
}}}

`add()` and `addOr()` only allow simple logical operations on a single condition. For more complex logic,  Propel 1.4 forced you to use Criterions again. This is no longer the case in Propel 1.5, which provides a new `Criteria::combine()` method. It expects an array of named conditions to be combined, and an operator. Use `Criteria::addCond()` to create a condition, instead of the usual `add()`:

{{{
#!php
<?php
$c = new Criteria();
$c->addCond('cond1', BookPeer::TITLE, 'Foo', Criteria::EQUAL); // creates a condition named 'cond1'
$c->addCond('cond2', BookPeer::TITLE, 'Bar', Criteria::EQUAL); // creates a condition named 'cond2'
$c->combine(array('cond1', 'cond2'), Criteria::LOGICAL_OR);    // combine 'cond1' and 'cond2' with a logical OR
// translates in SQL as
// WHERE (book.TITLE = 'Foo' OR book.TITLE = 'Bar');
}}}
 
`combine()` accepts more than two conditions at a time:
{{{
#!php
<?php
$c = new Criteria();
$c->addCond('cond1', BookPeer::TITLE, 'Foo', Criteria::EQUAL);
$c->addCond('cond2', BookPeer::TITLE, 'Bar', Criteria::EQUAL);
$c->addCond('cond3', BookPeer::TITLE, 'FooBar', Criteria::EQUAL);
$c->combine(array('cond1', 'cond2', 'cond3'), Criteria::LOGICAL_OR);
// translates in SQL as
// WHERE ((book.TITLE = 'Foo' OR book.TITLE = 'Bar') OR book.TITLE = 'FooBar');
}}}

`combine()` itself can return a named condition to be combined later. So it allows for any level of logical complexity:

{{{
#!php
<?php
$c = new Criteria();

$c->addCond('cond1', BookPeer::TITLE, 'Foo', Criteria::EQUAL);
$c->addCond('cond2', BookPeer::TITLE, 'Bar', Criteria::EQUAL);
$c->combine(array('cond1', 'cond2'), Criteria::LOGICAL_OR, 'cond12');

$c->addCond('cond3', BookPeer::ISBN, '1234', Criteria::EQUAL);
$c->addCond('cond4', BookPeer::ISBN, '4567', Criteria::EQUAL);
$c->combine(array('cond3', 'cond4'), Criteria::LOGICAL_OR, 'cond34');

$c->combine(array('cond12', 'cond34'), Criteria::LOGICAL_AND);

// WHERE (book.TITLE = 'Foo' OR book.TITLE = 'Bar') 
//   AND (book.ISBN = '1234' OR book.ISBN = '4567');
}}}

The new `combine()` method makes it much easier to handle logically complex criterions. The good news is that if your application code already uses the old Criterion way, it will continue to work with Propel 1.5 as all these changes are backwards compatible.

Of course, since Model Queries extend Criteria, this new feature is available for all your queries, with a slightly different syntax, in order to support column phpNames:

{{{
#!php
<?php
$books = Bookquery::create()
    ->condition('cond1', 'Book.Title = ?', 'Foo')
    ->condition('cond2', 'Book.Title = ?', 'Bar')
  ->combine(array('cond1', 'cond2'), Criteria::LOGICAL_OR, 'cond12')
    ->condition('cond3', 'Book.ISBN = ?', '1234')
    ->condition('cond4', 'Book.ISBN = ?', '4567')
  ->combine(array('cond3', 'cond4'), Criteria::LOGICAL_OR, 'cond34')
  ->combine(array('cond12', 'cond34'), Criteria::LOGICAL_AND)
  ->find();
// WHERE (book.TITLE = 'Foo' OR book.TITLE = 'Bar') 
//   AND (book.ISBN = '1234' OR book.ISBN = '4567');
}}}

== Many-to-Many Relationships ==

At last, Propel generates the necessary methods to retrieve related objects in a many-to-many relationship. Since this feature is often needed, many developers already wrote these methods themselves. To avoid method collision, the generation of many-to-many getters is therefore optional.

All you have to do is to add the `isCrossRef` attribute to the cross reference table, and rebuild your model. For instance, if a `User` has many `Groups`, and the `Group` has many `Users`, the many-to-many relationship is materialized by a `user_group` cross reference table:

{{{
#!xml
<table name="user">
  <column name="id" type="INTEGER" primaryKey="true" autoIncrement="true"/>
  <column name="name" type="VARCHAR" size="32"/>
</table>

<table name="group">
  <column name="id" type="INTEGER" primaryKey="true" autoIncrement="true"/>
  <column name="name" type="VARCHAR" size="32"/>
</table>

<table name="user_group" isCrossRef="true">
  <column name="user_id" type="INTEGER" primaryKey="true"/>
  <column name="group_id" type="INTEGER" primaryKey="true"/>
  <foreign-key foreignTable="user">
    <reference local="user_id" foreign="id"/>
  </foreign-key>
  <foreign-key foreignTable="group">
    <reference local="group_id" foreign="id"/>
  </foreign-key>
</table>
}}}

Then, both end of the relationship see the other end through a one-to-many relationship. That means that you can deal with related objects just like you normally do, without ever creating instances of the cross reference object:

{{{
#!php
<?php
// create and relate objects as if they shared a one-to-many relationship
$user = new User();
$user->setName('John Doe');
$group = new Group();
$group->setName('Anonymous');
// relate $user and $group
$user->addGroup($group);
// save the $user object, the $group object, and a new instance of the UserGroup class
$user->save();

// retrieve objects as if they shared a one-to-many relationship
$groups = $user->getGroups();

// the model query also features a smart filter method for the relation
$groups = GroupPeer::create()
  ->filterByUser($user)
  ->find();
}}}

The syntax should be no surprise, since it's the same as the one for one-to-many relationships. Find more details about many-to-many relationships in the [wiki:Users/Documentation/1.5/Relationships relationships documentation].

== New Behaviors ==

The new behavior system, introduced in Propel 1.4, starts to unleash its true power with this release. Three new behaviors implement the most common customizations of object models: `nested_sets`, `sluggable`, and `sortable`.

=== Nested Set Behavior ===

Using the `treeMode` attribute in a schema, you could turn a Propel model into a hierarchical data store starting with Propel 1.3. This method is now deprecated in favor of a new `nested_set` behavior, that does eactly the same thing, but in a more extensible and effective way.

The main difference between the two implementations is performance. On the first levels of a large tree, the Propel 1.3 implementation of Nested sets used to consume a very large amount of memory and CPU to retrieve the siblings or the children of a given node. This is no longer true with the new behavior.

This performance boost comes at a small price: you must add a new "level" column to your nested set models, and let the behavior update this column for the whole tree.

For instance, if you used nested sets to keep a list of categories, the schema used to look like:

{{{
#!xml
<table name="category" treeMode="NestedSet">
  <column name="id" primaryKey="true" autoIncrement="true" type="INTEGER"/>
  <column name="left" nestedSetLeftKey="true" type="INTEGER"/>
  <column name="right" nestedSetLeftKey="true" type="INTEGER"/>
  <column name="name" required="true" type="VARCHAR" size="10" />
</table>
}}}

The upgrade path is then pretty straightforward:

1 - Update the schema, by removing the `treeMode` and `nestedSet` attributes and adding the `nested_set` behavior and the `tree_level` column:

{{{
#!xml
<table name="category">
  <column name="id" primaryKey="true" autoIncrement="true" type="INTEGER"/>
  <column name="left" type="INTEGER"/>
  <column name="right" type="INTEGER"/>
  <column name="tree_level" type="INTEGER"/>
  <column name="name" required="true" type="VARCHAR" size="10" />
  <behavior name="nested_set">
    <parameter name="left_column" value="left" />
    <parameter name="right_column" value="right" />
    <parameter name="level_column" value="tree_level" />
  </behavior>
</table>
}}}

2 - Rebuild the model

3 - Change the parent class of your model classes (object and peer) that used the nested set `treeMode`:

{{{
#!php
<?php
// use
class Category extends BaseCategory
// instead of
class Category extends BaseCategoryNestedSet

// use
class CategoryPeer extends BaseCategoryPeer
// instead of
class CategoryPeer extends BaseCategoryNestedSetPeer
}}}

4 - Add the level column to the database. For instance, in MySQL:

{{{
#!xml
ALTER TABLE `category` ADD COLUMN tree_level INTEGER;
}}}

5 - Update the level value in the existing nodes, using the `fixLevels()` Peer method

{{{
#!php
<?php
// run it once
CategoryPeer::fixLevels();
}}}

The nested set behavior implementation has a few added benefits:

 * All the methods that execute several queries use transactions, so a database failure won't break a tree anymore
 * The methods retrieveing a list of nodes accept a Criteria as first parameter, to filter the results
 * New methods make it easier to work with trees: `retrieveRoots()`, `isDescendantOf()`, `isAncestorOf()`, `getBranch()`, `addChild()`, etc.
 * There is no longer any introspection at runtime (for instance to check scope support), resulting in yet another boost in performance
 * A few bugs were fixed (for instance in the use of `delete()`)
 * A node can be inserted to the tree after it is saved. This allows for better preparation of data before insertion in the tree
 * The new implementation is much more robust, thanks to a ''full unit testing coverage''. That's more than 350 unit tests to ensure that your trees won't ever break due to an incorrect piece of code in the nested sets.
 * The API was rethought to make it more intuitive - but with method proxies to keep BC

As a consequence, the use of `treeMode="NestedSet"` in a schema is deprecated. Check the new [wiki:Users/Documentation/1.5/Behaviors/nested_set nested_set behavior documentation] for more details.

=== Sluggable Behavior ===

This behavior answers a very common need: to give a model a unique string representation that can be used to make a user-friendly URL.

The classical example is that of a blog engine, where you need every record of a `post` table to have a unique URL. Simply enable the `sluggable` behavior in your schema and rebuild the model:

{{{
#!xml
<table name="post">
  <column name="id" required="true" primaryKey="true" autoIncrement="true" type="INTEGER" />
  <column name="title" type="VARCHAR" required="true" primaryString="true" />
  <column name="content" type="LONGVARCHAR"/>
  <behavior name="sluggable">
    <parameter name="slug_pattern" value="/posts/{Title}" />
  </behavior>
</table>
}}}

Now, every time you save a new `Post` object, Propel will compose its slug according to the pattern defined in the behavior parameter and save it in an additional `slug` column:

{{{
#!php
<?php
$post1 = new Post();
$post1->setTitle('How Is Life On Earth?');
$post1->setContent('Lorem Ipsum...');
$post1->save();
echo $post1->getSlug(); // '/posts/how-is-life-on-earth'
}}}

Propel replaces every name enclosed between brackets in the slug pattern by the related column value. It also cleans up the string to make it URL-compatible, and ensures that it is unique.

If you use this slug in URLs, you will need to retrieve a `Post` object based on it. This is just a one-liner:

{{{
#!php
<?php
$post = PostQuery::create()->findOneBySlug('/posts/how-is-life-on-earth');
}}}

There are many ways to customize the `sluggable` behavior to match the needs of your applications. Check the new [wiki:Users/Documentation/1.5/Behaviors/sluggable sluggable behavior documentation] for more details.

=== Concrete Table Inheritance Behavior ===

Propel has offered [wiki:Users/Documentation/1.5/Inheritance#SingleTableInheritance Single Table Inheritance] for a long time. But for complex table inheritance needs, it is necessary to provide [http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/concreteTableInheritance.html Concrete Table Inheritance]. Starting with Propel 1.5, this inheritance implementation is supported through the new `concrete_inheritance` behavior.

In the following example, the `article` and `video` tables use this behavior to inherit the columns and foreign keys of their parent table, `content`:

{{{
#!xml
<table name="content">
  <column name="id" type="INTEGER" primaryKey="true" autoIncrement="true"/>
  <column name="title" type="VARCHAR" size="100"/>
  <column name="category_id" required="false" type="INTEGER" />
  <foreign-key foreignTable="category" onDelete="cascade">
    <reference local="category_id" foreign="id" />
  </foreign-key>
</table>
<table name="category">
  <column name="id" required="true" primaryKey="true" autoIncrement="true" type="INTEGER" />
  <column name="name" type="VARCHAR" size="100" primaryString="true" />
</table>
<table name="article">
  <behavior name="concrete_inheritance">
    <parameter name="extends" value="content" />
  </behavior>
  <column name="body" type="VARCHAR" size="100"/>
</table>
<table name="video">
  <behavior name="concrete_inheritance">
    <parameter name="extends" value="content" />
  </behavior>
  <column name="resource_link" type="VARCHAR" size="100"/>
</table>
}}}

The behavior copies the columns of the parent table to the child tables. That means that the generated `Article` and `Video` models have a `Title` property and a `Category` relationship:

{{{
#!php
<?php
// create a new Category
$cat = new Category();
$cat->setName('Movie');
$cat->save();
// create a new Article
$art = new Article();
$art->setTitle('Avatar Makes Best Opening Weekend in the History');
$art->setCategory($cat);
$art->setContent('With $232.2 million worldwide total, Avatar had one of the best-opening weekends in the history of cinema.');
$art->save();
// create a new Video
$vid = new Video();
$vid->setTitle('Avatar Trailer');
$vid->setCategory($cat);
$vid->setResourceLink('http://www.avatarmovie.com/index.html')
$vid->save();
}}}

If Propel stopped there, the `concrete_inheritance` behavior would only provide a shorcut to avoid repeating tags in the schema. But wait, there is more: the `Article` and `Video` classes actually extend the `Content` class:

{{{
#!php
<?php
class Content extends BaseContent
{
  public function getCategoryName()
  {
    return $this->getCategory()->getName();
  }
}
echo $art->getCategoryName(); // 'Movie'
echo $vid->getCategoryName(); // 'Movie'
}}}

And the true power of Propel's Concrete Table Inheritance is that every time you save an `Article` or a `Video` object, Propel saves a copy of the `title` and `category_id` columns in a `Content` object. Consequently, retrieving objects regardless of their child type becomes very easy:

{{{
#!php
<?php 
$conts = ContentQuery::create()->find();
foreach ($conts as $content) {
  echo $content->getTitle() . "(". $content->getCategoryName() ")/n";
}
// Avatar Makes Best Opening Weekend in the History (Movie)
// Avatar Trailer (Movie)
}}}

The resulting relational model is denormalized - in other terms, data is copied across tables - but the behavior takes care of everything for you. That allows for very effective read queries on complex inheritance structures.

Check out the brand new [wiki:Users/Documentation/1.5/Inheritance#ConcreteTableInheritance Inheritance Documentation] for more details on using and customizing this behavior.

=== Sortable Behavior ===

Have you ever enhanced a Propel Model to give it the ability to move up or down in an ordered list? The `sortable` behavior, new in Propel 1.5, offers exactly that... and even more.

As usual for behaviors, activate `sortable` in your `schema.yml`:

{{{
#!xml
<table name="task">
  <column name="id" required="true" primaryKey="true" autoIncrement="true" type="INTEGER" />
  <column name="title" type="VARCHAR" required="true" primaryString="true" />
  <column name="user_id" required="true" type="INTEGER" />
  <foreign-key foreignTable="user" onDelete="cascade">
    <reference local="user_id" foreign="id" />
  </foreign-key>
  <behavior name="sortable">
    <parameter name="use_scope" value="true" />
    <parameter name="scope_column" value="user_id" />
  </behavior>
</table>
}}}

Then rebuild your model, and you're done. You have just created an ordered task list for users:

{{{
#!php
<?php
// test users
$paul = new User();
$john = new User();

// create the tasks
$t1 = new Task();
$t1->setTitle('Wash the dishes');
$t1->setUser($paul);
$t1->save();
echo $t1->getRank(); // 1
$t2 = new Task();
$t2->setTitle('Do the laundry');
$t2->setUser($paul);
$t2->save();
echo $t2->getRank(); // 2
$t3 = new Task();
$t3->setTitle('Rest a little');
$t3->setUser($john);
$t3->save()
echo $t3->getRank(); // 1, because John has his own task list

// retrieve the tasks
$allPaulsTasks = TaskPeer::retrieveList($scope = $paul->getId());
$allJohnsTasks = TaskPeer::retrieveList($scope = $john->getId());
$t1 = TaskPeer::retrieveByRank($rank = 1, $scope = $paul->getId());
$t2 = $t1->getNext();
$t2->moveUp();
echo $t2->getRank(); // 1
echo $t1->getRank(); // 2
}}}

This new behavior is fully unit tested and very customizable. Check out all you can do with `sortable` in the [wiki:Users/Documentation/1.5/Behaviors/sortable sortable behavior documentation].

=== Timestampable Behavior ===

This behavior is not new, since it was introduced in Propel 1.4. However, with the introduction of model queries, it gains specific query methods that will ease your work when retrieving objects based on their update date:

{{{
#!php
<?php
$books = BookQuery::create()
  ->recentlyUpdated()  // adds a minimum value for the update date
  ->lastUpdatedFirst() // orders the results by descending update date
  ->find();
}}}

== Better `toArray()` ==

When you call `toArray()` on a model object, you can now ask for the related objects:

{{{
#!php
<?php
$bookArray = $book->toArray($keyType = BasePeer::TYPE_COLNAME, $includeLazyLoadColumns = true, $includeForeignObjects = true);
print_r($bookArray);
  => array(
       'Id'          => 123,
       'Title'       => 'War And Peace',
       'ISBN'        => '3245234535',
       'AuthorId'    => 456,
       'PublisherId' => 567
       'Author'      => array(
         'Id'          => 456,
         'FirstName'   => 'Leo',
         'LastName'    => 'Tolstoi'
       ), 
       'Publisher'   => array(
         'Id'          => 567,
         'Name'        => 'Penguin'
       )
     )
}}}

Only the related objects that were already hydrated appear in the result, so `toArray()` never issues additional queries. Together with the ability to return arrays instead of objects when using `PropelQuery`, this addition will help to debug and optimize model code.

== Better Oracle Support ==

The Oracle adapter for the generator, the reverse engineering, and the runtime components have been greatly improved. This should provide an easier integration of Propel with an Oracle database.

== Code Cleanup ==

=== Directory Structure Changes ===

The organization of the Propel runtime and generator code has been reworked, in order to make navigation across Propel classes easier for developers. End users should see no difference, apart if your `build.properties` references alternate builder classes in the Propel code. In that case, you will need to update your `build.properties` with the new paths. For instance, a reference to:

{{{
#!ini
propel.builder.peer.class = propel.engine.builder.om.php5.PHP5PeerBuilder
}}}

Must be changed to:

{{{
#!ini
propel.builder.peer.class = builder.om.PHP5PeerBuilder  
}}}

Browse the Propel generator directory structure to find the classes you need.

=== DebugPDO Refactoring ===

To allow custom connection handlers, the debug code that was written in the `DebugPDO` class has been moved to `PropelPDO`. The change is completely backwards compatible, but makes it easier to connect to a database without using PDO.

During the change, the [wiki:Users/Documentation/1.5/07-Logging documentation about Propel logging and debugging features] was rewritten and should now be clearer.

== propel-gen Script Modifications ==

The `propel-gen` script no longer requires a path to the project directory if you call it from a project directory. That means that calling `propel-gen` with a single argument defaults to expecting a task name:

{{{
> cd /path/to/my/project
> propel-gen reverse
}}}

By default, the `propel-gen` command called without a task name defaults to the `main` task (and builds the model, the SQL, and the generation).

Note: The behavior of the `propel-gen` script when called with one parameter differs from what it used to be in Propel 1.4, where the script expected a path in every situation. So the following syntax won't work anymore:

{{{
> propel-gen /path/to/my/project
}}}

Instead, use either:

{{{
> cd /path/to/my/project
> propel-gen
}}}

or:

{{{
> propel-gen /path/to/my/project main
}}}

== License Change ==

Propel is more open-source than ever. To allow for an easier distribution, the open-source license of the Propel library changes from LGPL3 to MIT. This [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License MIT License] is also known as the X11 License. 

This change removes a usage restriction enforced by the LGPL3: you no longer need to release any modifications to the core Propel source code under a LGPL compatible license. 

Of course, you still have the right to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell Propel. In other terms, you can do whatever you want with the Propel code, without worrying about the license, as long as you leave the LICENSE file within.

== Miscellaneous ==

 * Generated model classes now offer a `fromArray()` and a `toArray()` method by default. This feature existed before, but was disabled by default in the `build.properties`. The `addGenericAccessors` and `addGenericMutators` settings are therefore enabled by default in Propel 1.5.
 * You can now prefix all the table names of a database schema by setting the `tablePrefix` attribute of the `<database>` tag.
 * The `addIncludes` build property introduced in Propel 1.4 is now set to `false` by default. That means that the runtime autoloading takes care of loading all classes at runtime, including generated Base classes.
 * A bugfix in the name generator for related object getter in tables with two foreign keys related to the same table may have introduced problems in applications relying on old (wrong) names. Check your generated base model classes for the `getXXXrelatedByYYY()` and modify the application code relying on it if it exists. A good rule of thumb to avoid problems in such case is to name your relations by using the `phpName` and `refPhpName` attributes in the `<foreign-key>` element in the schema.
 * XSL transformation of your schemas is no longer enabled by default. Turn the `propel.schema.transform` setting to `true` in your `build.properties` to enable it again. This change removes the requirement on the libxslt extention for Propel.
 * `ModelObject::addSelectColumns()` now accepts an additional parameter to allow the use of table aliases
 * Added `ModelObject::clear()` to reinitialize a model object
 * Added `ModelObject::isPrimaryKeyNull()` method to check of an object was hydrated with no values (in case of a left join)
 * Added `Criteria::addSelectModifier($modifier)` to add more than one select modifier (e.g. 'SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS', 'HIGH_PRIORITY', etc.)
 * Added `PeerClass::addGetPrimaryKeyFromRow()` to retrieve the Primary key from a result row
 * Added a new set of constants in the generated Peer class to list column names without the table name (this is `BasePeer::TYPE_RAW_COLNAME`)
 * Removed references to Creole in the code (Propel uses PDO instead of Creole since version 1.3)
=======
= What's new in Propel 1.4? =

Propel 1.4 is a backwards compatible evolution of Propel 1.3. It offers lots of bugfixes, some very interesting new features, speed enhancements, and a very simple upgrade path: rebuild your model after updating Propel, and your application works as always. Except it works better...

== Pre and Post Hooks For `save()` And `delete()` Methods == 

The `save()` and `delete()` methods of your generated objects are now easier to override. In fact, Propel looks for one of the following methods in your objects and executes them when needed:

{{{
#!php
<?php
preInsert()            // code executed before insertion of a new object
postInsert()           // code executed after insertion of a new object
preUpdate()            // code executed before update of an existing object
postUpdate()           // code executed after update of an existing object
preSave()              // code executed before saving an object (new or existing)
postSave()             // code executed after saving an object (new or existing)
preDelete()            // code executed before deleting an object
postDelete()           // code executed after deleting an object
}}}

So for instance, you can force the update of a `created_at` column in a `book` table before every insertion as follows:

{{{
#!php
<?php
class Book extends BaseBook
{
  public function preInsert(PropelPDO $con = null)
  {
    $this->setCreatedAt(time());
  }
}
}}}

Since this new feature adds a small overhead to write operations, you can deactivate it in your build properties by setting `propel.addHooks` to `false`.

{{{
#!ini
# -------------------
#  TEMPLATE VARIABLES
# -------------------
propel.addHooks = false
}}}

== Behaviors ==

You can now package and reuse behaviors across your models. For instance, keeping the date of creation of an object and the date of latest update is as simple as declaring the `timestampable` behavior in the table declaration:

{{{
#!xml
<table name="book">
  <column name="id" required="true" primaryKey="true" autoIncrement="true" type="INTEGER" />
  <column name="title" type="VARCHAR" required="true" />
  <behavior name="timestampable" />
</table>
}}}

Rebuild your model, and you now have two new columns in the `book` table automatically set to the creation and update dates:

{{{
#!php
<?php
$b = new Book();
$b->setTitle('War And Peace');
$b->save();
echo $b->getCreatedAt(); // 2009-10-02 18:14:23
echo $b->getUpdatedAt(); // 2009-10-02 18:14:23
$b->setTitle('Anna Karenina');
$b->save();
echo $b->getCreatedAt(); // 2009-10-02 18:14:23
echo $b->getUpdatedAt(); // 2009-10-02 18:14:25
}}}

Propel behaviors occur at build time, so they have absolutely no overhead. Thay can modify the database schema, alter the methods generated by Propel, and add methods of their own in both the model and Peer classes. As a matter of fact, this new feature is so powerful that it requires a documentation on its own. Read it in the [wiki:Users/Documentation/1.4#HowTos HowTos] section.

Propel 1.4 already bundles a few behaviors, like `timestampable` and `soft_delete`. Check the documentation linked above for more details.

== Joins with multiple conditions ==

You can now create joins with any number of conditions and any comparator using the new `Criteria::addMultipleJoin()` method.

{{{
#!php
<?php
$c = new Criteria();
$c->addMultipleJoin(array(
    array(ReaderFavoritePeer::BOOK_ID, BookOpinionPeer::BOOK_ID),
    array(ReaderFavoritePeer::READER_ID, BookOpinionPeer::READER_ID))
  Criteria::INNER_JOIN);
}}}
{{{
#!sql
// SQL result
SELECT ...
FROM reader_favorite 
INNER JOIN book_opinion ON (reader_favorite.BOOK_ID = book_opinion.BOOK_ID 
                        AND reader_favorite.READER_ID = book_opinion.READER_ID)
}}}

You can add a third operator to each join condition to allow complex joins:

{{{
#!php
<?php
$c = new Criteria();
$c->addMultipleJoin(array(
    array(Book::USER_ID, UserPeer::ID))
    array(UserPeer::RANK, 12, Criteria::GREATER_THAN),
  Criteria::LEFT_JOIN);
}}}
{{{
#!sql
// SQL result
SELECT ...
FROM book
LEFT JOIN user ON (book.USER_ID = user.ID AND user.RANK > 12)
}}}

Note that the former way to define a composite join using arrays as arguments of `addJoin()` is deprecated.

== Full Query Logging ==

Propel can now log all the queries issued to the database in their exact syntax, including parameter binding. That means that you can easily copy a query from the Propel logs and execute it in your database to see the result immediately.

In addition, Propel can log the time and memory spent on every query, or only on slow query, depending on a treshold that you can customize.

Last but not least, you can check the number of executer queries and the SQL code of the latest executed query at runtime.

Propel 1.2 users may not find these features spectacular, but by switching from Creole to PDO, Propel lost its powerful logging abilities in version 1.3. Propel 1.4 logging is now on par with Propel 1.2 logging again.

All this is possible thanks to a new connection class, called `DebugPDO`. To enable it, just change the connection `<classname>` to 'DebugPDO' in the `runtime-conf.xml` file, as follows:

{{{
#!xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<config>
  <propel>
    <datasources default="bookstore">
      <datasource id="bookstore">
        <adapter>sqlite</adapter>
        <connection>
          <classname>DebugPDO</classname>
}}}

That's all. After this change, Propel logs all the queries executed at runtime in its default log file:

{{{
time:  0.002 sec | mem: 1.4 MB | INSERT INTO publisher (`ID`,`NAME`) VALUES (NULL,'William Morrow')
time:  0.000 sec | mem: 1.4 MB | INSERT INTO author (`ID`,`FIRST_NAME`,`LAST_NAME`) VALUES (NULL,'J.K.','Rowling')
time:  0.000 sec | mem: 1.6 MB | INSERT INTO book (`ID`,`TITLE`,`ISBN`,`PRICE`,`PUBLISHER_ID`,`AUTHOR_ID`) VALUES (NULL,'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix','043935806X',10.99,53,58)
time:  0.000 sec | mem: 1.7 MB | INSERT INTO review (`ID`,`REVIEWED_BY`,`REVIEW_DATE`,`RECOMMENDED`,`BOOK_ID`) VALUES (NULL,'Washington Post','2009-10-04',1,52)
...
time:  0.001 sec | mem: 2.1 MB | SELECT bookstore_employee_account.EMPLOYEE_ID, bookstore_employee_account.LOGIN FROM `bookstore_employee_account` WHERE bookstore_employee_account.EMPLOYEE_ID=25
}}}

Check the [wiki:Users/Documentation/1.4/Full-Query-Logging Full Query Logging Documentation] for details on the `DebugPDO` documentation.

== Generated `__toString()` in Base Object ==

Propel can generate a `__toString()` method for your Model objects if you define a column as `primaryString` in the schema:

{{{
#!xml
<table name="book" phpName="Book">
  ..
  <column name="title" type="varchar" size="125" primaryString="true" />
  ..
</table>
}}}   

After a model build, the generated `BaseBook` class offers the following magic method:

{{{
#!php
<?php
public function __toString()
{
  return (string) $this->getTitle();
}
}}}

That means that the default string representation of `Book` objects is the value of the `title` column:

{{{
#!php
<?php
$book = new book();
$book->setTitle('War And Peace');
echo $book; // 'War And Peace'
}}}

== New Peer constant: OM_CLASS ==

Did you ever try to get the Propel Model class related to a Peer class? If you did, you probably noticed that the only available constant providing this information also contained package information:

{{{
#!php
<?php
// in BaseBookPeer.php
/** A class that can be returned by this peer. */
const CLASS_DEFAULT = 'bookstore.Book';
}}}

This can be useful if you don't use autoloading; but if you do, retrieving the actual Propel model class name involved some string operations to remove the package information. This is no more necessary in Propel 1.4, since the Peer classes offer a new constant:

{{{
#!php
<?php
// in BaseBookPeer.php
/** the related Propel class for this table */
const OM_CLASS = 'Book';
}}}

The generated Peer methods now use this constant and avoid string operations. Therefore, they should be slightly faster.

== PropelPager Implements Countable and Iterator Interfaces ==

Did you know Propel offered a pagination utility class? It just got better, by now supporting the `Countable` and `Iterator` interfaces. That means that you can manipulate a `PropelPager` object as if it was an array:

{{{
#!php
<?php
$c = new Criteria();
$c->add(BookPeer::AUTHOR, $authorId);
$pager = new PropelPager($c, 'BookPeer', 'doSelect', $page = 1, $rowsPerPage = 20);

if(count($pager)) // if the current page has results
{
  foreach($pager as $book) // get pager results and iterate on them
  {
    echo $book->getTitle();
  }
}
}}}

Note that the `PropelPager` utility has a brand new documentation in the [wiki:Users/Documentation/1.4#HowTos HowTos] section. 

== Better Introspection at Runtime ==

A few methods were added to the Map classes to ease runtime introspection, as well as a new `RelationMap` class to describe database relationships:
{{{
TableMap    DatabaseMap::getTableByPhpName($name) // TableMap object by object model name, e.g. 'Book'
ColumnMap   DatabaseMap::getColumn($name) // ColumnMap object by fully qualified name, e.g. book.AUTHOR_ID
Array       TableMap::getPrimaryKeys()    // List of the ColumnMap objects corresponding to the table primary keys
Array       TableMap::getForeignKeys()    // List of the ColumnMap objects corresponding to the table foreign keys
Array       TableMap::getRelations()      // List of the table relationships, as RelationMap objects
String      TableMap::getPackage()        // Package of the table
mixed       ColumnMap::getDefaultValue()  // Default value defined in the schema for this column
TableMap    ColumnMap::getRelatedTable()  // Related TableMap object by foreign key
ColumnMap   ColumnMap::getRelatedColumn() // Related ColumnMap object by foreign key
RelationMap ColumnMap::getRelation()      // Related RelationMap object   
integer     RelationMap::getType()        // RelationMap::ONE_TO_MANY, RelationMap::MANY_TO_ONE, or RelationMap::ONE_TO_ONE
string      RelationMap::getOnDelete()    // ON DELETE directive, e.g. 'SET NULL'
TableMap    RelationMap::getLocalTable()  // Local TableMap object (the one bearing the fkey)
TabkeMap    RelationMap::getForeignTable()   // Foreign TableMap object
Array       RelationMap::getColumnMappings() // List of local => foreign column for this relation, e.g array('book.PUBLISHER_ID' => 'publisher.ID')
Array       RelationMap::getLocalColumns()   // List of the ColumnMap objects on the local side of the relation
Array       RelationMap::getForeignColumns() // List of the ColumnMap objects on the foreign side of the relation
}}}

Check the new [wiki:Users/Documentation/1.4/Runtime-Introspection Runtime Introspection] documentation in the [wiki:Users/Documentation/1.4#HowTos HowTos] section for a complete description of the introspection API.

Also, it is now much easier to get the name of the Propel object class from the Peer class:
{{{
echo BookPeer::getOMClass()                    => 'bookstore.Book'
echo BookPeer::getOMClass($withPrefix = false) => 'Book'
}}}

== MapBuilders are gone ==

Runtime introspection used to rely on runtime builder classes for TableMap objects, called MapBuilders. These classes are not generated anymore by Propel. Instead, Propel generates TableMap classes that are easier to deal with. 

The standard way to get a TableMap through the Peer classes works just the same as before:

{{{
#!php
<?php
$bookTableMap = BookPeer::getTableMap();
}}}

But building TableMaps by hand is a lot easier:

{{{
#!php
<?php
// Propel 1.3 way to initialize a TableMap
$className = 'Book';
$mapBuilderClass = $className . 'MapBuilder';
$mapBuilder = new $mapBuilderClass();
if (!$mapBuilder->isBuilt())
{
  $mapBuilder->doBuild();
}
$bookTableMap = $databaseMap->getTable('book');

// Propel 1.4 way to initialize a TableMap
$className = 'Book';
$tableMapClass = $className . 'TableMap';
$bookTableMap = $databaseMap->addTableFromMapClass($tableMapClass);
}}}

Note that if you want to make sure that all the tables related to a given table have their TableMaps loaded, you just need to ask for the table relations:

{{{
#!php
<?php
// build all the TableMap objects of tables related to Book
$relations = $bookTableMap->getRelations();
}}}

== New Build Options ==

You now have more control over the generated classes, through three new settings in `build.properties`:

{{{
propel.addValidateMethod = {true}|false
}}}
Whether to add `validate()` method to your classes. Set to false if you don't use Propel validation. 

{{{
propel.addIncludes = {true}|false
}}}
Whether to add `require` statements on the generated stub classes. Set to false if you autoload every classe at runtime.

{{{
propel.addHooks = {true}|false
}}}
Whether to support pre- and post- hooks on `save()` and `delete()` methods. Set to false if you never use these hooks for a small speed boost.

== Foreign Key Retrievers Now Use Instance Pool ==

When you retrieve an object related to the current model object by a foreign key, you usually use a method generated by Propel, as follows:

{{{
#!php
<?php
$author = $book->getAuthor(); // $author is an Author instance
}}}

Behind the curtain, this method uses the `author_id` property of the current book object, makes a query to the database for the related `author` record, and hydrates an `Author` object with the result. But what if you already have hydrated this author object earlier in the script? Thanks to instance pooling, Propel remembers the objects it has in memory, which can save a lot of database queries. For instance:

{{{
#!php
<?php
foreach($author->getBooks() as $book)
{
	echo $book->getTitle();
  echo $book->getAuthor()->getName();
}
}}}

In Propel 1.3, this code would issue n+1 queries to the database (n being the number of books written by $author). But with Propel 1.4, this code only executes one query. As the `getAuthor()` method is called, Propel knows that the author of each book is already in memory, and therefore skips the database query and the hydration process altogether. hte result is a slight speed boost, and a decrease in the number of queries executed per page.

== `BasePeer::populateStmtValues()` is now public ==

You can now use a SQL query of your own, or modify the one returned by `BasePeer::createSelectSql()`, and use the binding capabilities of Propel to populate a query with a set of values. Propel uses the PDO type of the column to do the binding, so this method may save you some hassle: 

{{{
#!php
<?php
$sql = BasePeer::createSelectSql($criteria, $params);
$sql = "INSERT INTO temp_table_name $sql";
$stmt = $con->prepare($sql);
BasePeer::populateStmtValues($stmt, $params, $dbMap, $db);
$stmt->execute();
}}}

== Documentation Reorganization ==

The Propel documentation now lies in the Subversion repository. It becomes easier to contribute and trace documentation changes, attach corrections to tickets, and bundle the Propel library as a self-containing package.

Of course, the documentation has been updated to reflect all the changes described above, and all the new features are fully documented.

== Twice As Many Unit Tests ==

The Propel 1.4 development process introduced Test-Driven Development. As a consequence, the number of unit tests in the Propel codebase has dramatically increased. In fact, it has more than doubled since Propel 1.3. Propel is still far from a large unit test code coverage, but the stability and robustness of the Propel library get better every day.
